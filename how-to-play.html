        <h2>Moving & Placing Cards</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cards that can be moved have a white highlight around them.</li>
            <li>To move a card (click/touch) on a moveable card and drag to have the card follow your (mouse/finger).
            </li>
            <li>When a card is moved, all valid moves are checked, any slot that the card can be dropped into will have
                a black highlight.</li>
            <li>When a card is dropped, if it is above a valid slot it will added to that slot, if a card is dropped
                into an invalid slot or anywhere else on the board it will return to it's origin slot.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Press Play to deal a new numbered grid (The inner 3 x 3 grid).</li>
            <li>To fill the inner grid cards are drawn from a shuffled deck until all 9 slots are filled with
                numbered cards.(Any card with a value between 2-10)</li>
            <li>If a card is drawn that isn't a numbered card between 2-10 it gets then it is placed into it's
                associated deck, Royals to the hand, Aces & Jokers to their own decks.</li>
            <li>Now place the all royal cards onto the royal grid slots(The outer 12 slots)</li>
            <li>A royal must be placed adjacent to the most similar card on the numbered grid.</li>
            <li>When all the royals have been placed, a card from the numbered grid may be swapped for a new card from
                the deck. If the numbered grid has a lot of high value cards then this is a good option to open up more
                possible moves.</li>
            <li>The game setup is now finished.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Goal</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Find all the royals and place them on the board.</li>
            <li>Defeat all the royals by using numbered cards to attack them.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Card Types</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Numbered: These are used to make attacks on the royals, they can placed on the inner 3x3 grid on top of
                any card of the same or lower value. If there is no valid move on the inner grid then the card's value
                is added to the
                armour of the most similar royal and the card is put into the discard deck and is no longer part of the
                game. If you have a ploy left considering using the ploy to prevent adding armour to the royals. </li>
            <li>Royals: These are the enemy cards and must be defeated to win the game, they can be placed in the outer
                12 grid slots next the most similar numbered card.
            </li>
            <li>Ploys: Aces and Jokers are ploy cards that allow special moves, these can be placed into the associated
                deck when drawn or used on the numbered grid straight away.</li>
            <li>Aces(Extractions): These can be used to shuffle a stack of cards from the numbered grid back into the
                deck, this leaves a blank slot on the grid that any numbered card can be played onto and gives you more
                cards to play so you don't run out of moves. Drop an Ace on an numbered grid slot to extract it. The Ace
                is then placed in the discard and no longer part of the game.</li>
            <li>Jokers(Reassignments): These can be used to move the top card of a numbered slot to another numbered
                slot, the reassigned top card must follow the normal rules for placing a numbered card and must be
                placed on a slot with a card value of equal or lower value. Drop a Joker on a numbered grid slot to
                reassign it. The Joker is the placed in the discard pile and is no longer part of the game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Once setup is complete a card is drawn from the deck and put into hand.</li>
            <li>Cards can now be played from the hand, aces and joker deck.</li>
            <li>If a card is played from the hand then a new card is drawn from the deck and placed in the hand.</li>
            <li>If a ploy is played from hand or from Aces or Jokers deck it is added to the discard deck and is no
                longer part of the game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Attacking the royals</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To attack a royal a numbered card must be placed opposite it on the numbered grid, this means there are
                2 numbered cards between the placed card and the royal card.</li>
            <li>When a numbered card is placed opposite it attacks the royal for the sum of the 2 numbered cards
                in-between.</li>
            <li>If that sum is greater than the royals value (ie a King's value is 13) plus the royals armour then the
                royal is defeated.</li>
            <li>Each royal has it's own extra requirement for an attack to be successful.
                <ul>
                    <li>Kings require the attack cards to be the same suit as the king.</li>
                    <li>Queens require the attack cards to be the same colour as the queen.</li>
                    <li>Jacks allow the attack cards to be any suit or colour.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Winning & Losing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The game is won if all the royals are defeated.</li>
            <li>The game is lost if there are no cards left in the deck and no ploys left to play.</li>
            <li>The game is lost if a royal becomes too powerful to defeat, this happens if a royal gains enough armour
                that it's value plus armour exceeds 20, since the most an attack can be made for is 20.</li>
        </ul>
